#Portfolio Website

## Retro Terminal Portfolio

A personal portfolio website designed with a **retro green-and-black command line aesthetic**, built entirely using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This was my **first project in web development**, showcasing my interests, background, and work in a stylized, minimalist interface inspired by early terminal systems.

## 🌟 Highlights

-  **Terminal-Themed Interface** – A unique design inspired by classic green-on-black command line UIs.
-  **Pure HTML, CSS & JS** – No frameworks or libraries; built from the ground up to learn web fundamentals.
-  **Responsive Layout** – Looks great on desktops and adjusts cleanly for smaller screens.
-  **Navigation Mimics Command Prompts** – Includes a simulated shell prompt to "type" or click through sections.
-  **Intro to Web Dev** – Served as a hands-on introduction to front-end development and web hosting.

## 📖 Overview

This portfolio was my first hands-on experience in web development. I wanted to combine learning core web technologies with a design that felt personal and technically nostalgic. Inspired by old-school terminals and hacking culture, the site uses **monospace fonts**, **glow effects**, and **typewriter animations** to simulate a working CLI interface (intentionally made to look incorrect).

The site includes:

- **Intro/About section** – Background and motivation
- **Tools** - Interactive objects symbolizing tools and languages I am familiar with
- **Projects** – Selected work displayed as “commands”
- **Contact** – Email and social media links embedded in a stylized output

## 🚀 Future Improvements

While the project is complete in its initial version, some ideas for enhancements include:

- Adding an actual input prompt to simulate typed commands
- Theme toggling between light and dark terminal aesthetics
- Rebuilding the site with React or another JS framework for practice
